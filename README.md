### Build Width
1. Html
2. CSS
3. javascript

### Programme logic :

1. The user is asked to select the length of the password and the characters he needs in his password. 
2. I created arrays for Uppercase, Lowercase, Special Characters and Numbers.
3. I Also created an empty array chars[], and depending on the user's choice of character , the created arrays would be pushed into the empty array chars[].
4. I used Math.random to randomly select values from the chars[] array.
